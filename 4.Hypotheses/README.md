## About-
Around seven migration indicators derived from the census tale, we construct eight hypotheses and test these hypotheses. These hypotheses mainly revolve around the differences noticed between how, where, which and why people migrate. These emperical insights can help us identify migration clusters in India which can aid the government to drive targeted development backed by what trends predict.
