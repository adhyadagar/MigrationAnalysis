## Introduction

    One important facet of study on population is the study of migration arising out of various social, economic or political reasons. For a large country like India, the study of movement of population in different parts of the country helps in understanding the dynamics of the society better. At this junction in the economic development, in the country, especially when many states are undergoing faster economic development, particularly in areas, such as, manufacturing, information technology or service sectors, data migration profile of population has become more important.

    According to the Indian census, when a person is enumerated in census at a different place than his / her place of birth, she / he is considered a migrant. This may be due to marriage, which is the most common reason for migration among females-or for work, what is the case as generally among males, etc. It also happens that many return to their place of birth after staying out. To capture such movements of population census collect information on migration by last helps to understand the current migration scenario better.
    
    Migration is often driven by the search for better livelihoods and new opportunities. Indeed, global and regional social and economic inequalities are expressed most powerfully through the figure of the migrant, as one who crosses borders in search of work, education and new horizons. Hence it is important to study this phenomenon as it can serve as an proxy to study socioeconomic development of an area.
    
    
    This study is a continuation to the research done by Goswami et al.and uses the results given in the paper.
    
    ### In this paper, the intent has been to complete the following tasks: 
        -To download data from web to create a comprehensive table of variables based on Census 2001 & Census 2011 for analysis.
        -To discretize the continuous variables by using clustering algorithms with an aim to keep the labels consistent over the two Census and to enable a simple comparison of the migration states over the years.
        -To study the pattern of Census 2011 and finally use statistical analysis to formulate hypothesis based on observed patterns and test them using statistical tests.
        -To study association between migration and socioeconomic development in Indian districts
        -To seek answers to questions like:
            – Does migration lead to social development or vice versa?
            – Do men and women migrate in a similar way?
            – What are the prominent migration hubs in India and what causes this?
