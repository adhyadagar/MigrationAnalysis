## D Series Migration Tables of all districts from 2011

### Important Definitions while reading the data

- __Migrants by place of birth__ are those who are enumerated at a village/town at the time of census other than their place of birth.

- A person is considered as __migrant by place of last residence__, if the place in which he is enumerated during the census is other than his place of immediate last residence. By capturing the latest of the migrations in cases where persons have migrated more than once, this concept would give a better picture of current migration scenario.
