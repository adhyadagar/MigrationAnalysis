How to view maps? 

1. Create geojson file by running _script_to_create_geojson.py_. Make sure init.geojson is in the same folder as this file as it contains all shapefiles of the     districts you want to plot.
[I cannot upload the init.geojson file here because of it's size. It can be downloaded from my drive - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-B8mREjqxAg4IU-xaRzT2gqtxWt5H7PE/view?usp=sharing]
2. Input to the above file should be an excel file with the clusters/indicators you want to plot along with census district codes.
3. After you run the code above, you will get a sample html page of the indicator you have just plotted.
